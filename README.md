As a learner in the field of Operations Research, I was always amazed by the depth of knowledge and diversity of applicable scenarios of OR. ALthough there are already many excellent books, papers and blogs introducing various kinds of OR weapons, I still find myself lacking a systematic and comprehensive connaisance about OR. Therefore, an idea came into my mind, which was 
to construct an OR dictionary which tries to cover all areas of OR as much as possible. It doesn't have to give every detail about a specific technique, its principal target is to provide a touchable cognition under a system, where extra references are also provided if further learning is necessary.
